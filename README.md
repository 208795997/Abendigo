# Abendigo
Free and open-source game modding platform using the JVM. You can visit our community here: https://abendigo.org

---

The project was originally started as a closed-source cheat and everything was done in-house. We since decided to move the project on to a new vision: a free and open-source modding platform.

Initially there will be a focus on CS:GO because it was our original game target. In the future other games may be supported.

### Dependencies

We use some really cool technology to drive Abendigo. Here's a list:

- [Kotmem](https://github.com/Jire/kotmem) for our high-level interfacing with processes
- [Java Native Access (JNA)](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) as the backbone for interfacing with native libraries
