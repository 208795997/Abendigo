We since decided to move the project on to a new vision: a free and open-source modding platform.\r\n\r\nInitially there will be a focus on CS:GO because it was our original game target. In the future other games may be supported.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nWe use some really cool technology to drive Abendigo. Here's a list:\r\n\r\n- [Arrowhead](https://github.com/Jire/Arrowhead) for our high-level interfacing with processes\r\n- [Java Native Access (JNA)](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) as the backbone for interfacing with native libraries\r\n- [Netty](http://netty.io) for our controller server's networking\r\n\r\n## Building from source\r\n\r\nYou can watch this video guide to show you how to build from source.\r\n\r\n[![View on YouTube](http://i.imgur.com/fzn2l86.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jd0fDMDjxw)\r\n\r\n## Official controller client\r\n\r\nYou can find our official controller client here: https://github.com/Jire/Abendigo-Controller\r\n\r\nOur controller protocol is very simple, you can also easily make your own controller.",
